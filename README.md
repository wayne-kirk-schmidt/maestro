Maestro
=======

Want to be able to orchestrate QA testing at scale, at speed, and with security?

Whether you have a small code base of single files or a massie project with thousands of files, Maestro can help!

Strategy
========

Building testing pipelines is nothing new, but first we introduce a communication bus to democratize information and updates.

Next? Add the idea of a testing state engine, with three valid states: Passed, Failed, and Adjust.

We keep track of all of the tests to date, and put them into a bucket for analysis. 

*    Passed - continue onto the next test in the list.
*    Failed - collect context on the failure and stop with testing.
*    Adjust - examine the context of the results, adjust conditions, and redo the test.

Fully tested environment can be packaged, and shipped. Better yet, you can start to study the Failed and Adjust candidates 
and build up a better understanding of why the tests failed, and how to better adjust testing discipline.

To do this, you want someone or something that keeps tabs on the results, and builds up testing wisdom over time.
We proudly introduce the Maestro engine, which specialized in M.A.S.T.E.R. testing strategy.

Maestro is our adaptive machine analytics engine to coordinate all of this.

Goals
=====

- **Modular & Reusable**: The infrastructure should be adaptable for AWS and on-premise deployments.
- **Automated Deployment**: Use Terraform for provisioning, Docker for container orchestration, and Ansible for configuration management.
- **Security First**: Ensure secure access with SSH certificates and access controls.
- **Scalable & Maintainable**: Optimize configurations for scalability and long-term use.

Shopping List
=============

We use free and open source software (FOSS) but these components can be supplied by commercial off the shelf (COTS) equivalents.

Component List
==============
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AWS or on-prem provisioning.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Containerized services for Kafka, ELK, CMDB, Ticketing, and Testing.
- **Ansible** – Configuration management and fine-tuning.
- **Kafka** – Messaging bus for communication.
- **Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK)** – Centralized logging and monitoring.
- **i-doit CMDB** – Configuration management database.
- **Zammad** – Ticketing and IT service management.
- **Robot Framework** – Test automation.
- **Storage (S3/NFS)** – For logs, test artifacts, and output storage.
- **Secure Access** – SSH and certificates for authentication.

| **Zammad**       | Ticketing System                   | Manages IT service requests and incident tracking. |
| **Robot Framework** | Test Automation                 | Automates testing of deployed services. |
| **Storage (S3/NFS)** | Data Storage                  | Stores logs, test artifacts, and system backups. |
| **Secure Access** | Authentication & Security        | Manages SSH access and certificates for secure connectivity. |

Repository Structure
